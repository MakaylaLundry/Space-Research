# Introduction
Technology is growing exponentially, leading teams such as NASA, ESA, and CNSA to extend the duration and complexity of their missions. Additionally, space agriculture grows to be increasingly important, lending vital vitamins that you simply can't get from freeze-dried foods. More importantly, these plants provide unignorable vitamins and psychological benefits, oxygen production (+ CO2 removal), sustainable food supply, a better understanding of plant growth, and aesthetics. 

# Background
The Vegetable Production System, or Veggie, is a space garden that helps NASA study plant growth. This garden grows in a clay-based growth media and fertilizer, distributing water, nutrients, and air. This relatively small 22 in x 14 in x 9 in garden holds 6 plants and is stored in a growth chamber with magenta pink LED light to support growth. 

What has been successfully grown?
- Chinese Cabbage
- Mizuna mustard 
- Red Russian Kale
- Zinnia Flowers

The Advanced Plant Habitat is another space garden that aims to conduct plant research, similar to Veggie. 

How do they differ? ~ (different components)
- Light control(Quality, level, timing)
- Enclosed system 
- Automated 
- Cameras +180 sensors (connected to a team on the ground)
  - These sensors sense leaf temperature, root zone moisture/temp, water recovery/distribution, and atmosphere content.
- LEDS ~ red(630nm), green(530nm), blue(455nm), white(4100k), far-red(730nm) and infrared
