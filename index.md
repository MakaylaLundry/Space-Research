# Introduction
Technology is growing exponentially, leading teams such as NASA, ESA, and CNSA to extend the duration and complexity of their missions. Additionally, space agriculture grows to be increasingly important, lending vital vitamins that you simply can't get from freeze-dried foods. More importantly, these plants provide unignorable vitamins and psychological benefits, oxygen production (+ CO2 removal), sustainable food supply, a better understanding of plant growth, and aesthetics. 

# Background
The Vegetable Production System, or Veggie, is a space garden that helps NASA study plant growth. This garden grows in a clay-based growth media and fertilizer, distributing water, nutrients, and air. This relatively small 22 in x 14 in x 9 in garden holds 6 plants and is stored in a growth chamber with magenta pink LED light to support growth. 

What has been successfully grown?
- Chinese Cabbage
- Mizuna mustard 
- Red Russian Kale
- Zinnia Flowers

The Advanced Plant Habitat is another space garden that aims to conduct plant research, similar to Veggie. 

How do they differ? ~ (different components)
- Light control(Quality, level, timing)
- Enclosed system 
- Automated 
- Cameras +180 sensors (connected to a team on the ground)
  - These sensors sense leaf temperature, root zone moisture/temp, water recovery/distribution, and atmosphere content.
- LEDS ~ red(630nm), green(530nm), blue(455nm), white(4100k), far-red(730nm) and infrared

# Importance
A supply run to the Internation Space Station can cost from $9000 - $180000 per pound, which is why pre-packed and freeze-dried food is the norm, however, they not only break down over time but cause vitamin deficiencies which could pose a problem for longer missions. 

Aerospace agriculture, or ag aviation is also important for farmers. The growth rate, or GDP, is 3.6%, and we are predicted to reach 9.7 billion people by 2050. This means that it's increasingly important for farmers to produce greater yields, and it is because of aviation that we can keep up with the growing population. This is done by using fungicides and pesticides which improve the production and yield of crops. This keeps plants safe from fungus and bug outbreaks in a matter of minutes!

Other Earth Applications~
- Purifying water
- Killing pathogens
- Improving Cancer Treatment effectivness
- Reduce waste
- Food security
- Mitigating pressure on the planet's ecosystem 
- Vertical Farming
- Urban food Procution

Fun Fact- Cotton seeds were sent to the International Space Station to study the effects of gravity on roots, which could create a cotton plant that absorbs water more efficiently. This could be life-changing to places with drought such as Texas and China where drought has affected cotton production.

# LED
To successfully grow on the International Space Station, there would need to be efficient light, however, because there would be a closed environment and no sunlight in space, LEDs are used to mimic sunlight. In fact, LEDs come with unique benefits due to their ability to be modified without causing harm. 

Let's break it down:
- Light Spectrum/Efficiency: LED lighting makes it possible to adjust to the right spectrum of light while reducing energy consumption and heat output, which increases plant growth and produces greater yields. 
- Red Light: Promotes stem and leaf growth, best efficiency when it comes to absorbing chlorophyll. They are also electrically efficient with red light emitting more photons/watt when compared to other LED lights. (600-700nm)
- Blue Light: Increases plant quality by promoting stomatal opening which helps develop healthy leaves and encouraging seedling growth. (450 - 490nm)
- Green Light: Enhances plant productivity by putting more focus on lower leaves that didn't receive as much blue/red light. (500-600nm)
- White Light: Used more for observing. Pictures can be taken and more easily analyzed for pests, diseases, nutrient deficiencies, etc.
- Safety: LED Luminaires are put on 48VDC, which is considered safe and initiates that if any circuits are damaged there will be no risk of electrocution. To add, there is no risk of breakage when in contact with water.
- Sustainability: LEDs make it possible to recycle water/nutrients and increase the overall efficiency of resources. For example, Vertical farming uses way less soil, therefore preventing issues in traditional farming such as erosion, degradation, or depletion.
