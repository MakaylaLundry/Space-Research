## Introduction


Technology is growing exponentially, leading teams such as NASA, ESA, and CNSA to extend the duration and complexity of their missions. Additionally, space agriculture grows to be increasingly important, lending vital vitamins that you simply can't get from freeze-dried foods. More importantly, these plants provide unignorable vitamins and psychological benefits, oxygen production (+ CO2 removal), sustainable food supply, a better understanding of plant growth, and aesthetics. 

## Background
The Vegetable Production System, or Veggie, is a space garden that helps NASA study plant growth. This garden grows in a clay-based growth media and fertilizer, distributing water, nutrients, and air. This relatively small 22 in x 14 in x 9 in garden holds 6 plants and is stored in a growth chamber with magenta pink LED light to support growth. 

What has been successfully grown?
- Chinese Cabbage
- Mizuna mustard 
- Red Russian Kale
- Zinnia Flowers

The Advanced Plant Habitat is another space garden that aims to conduct plant research, similar to Veggie. 

How do they differ? ~ (different components)
- Light control(Quality, level, timing)
- Enclosed system 
- Automated 
- Cameras +180 sensors (connected to a team on the ground)
  - These sensors sense leaf temperature, root zone moisture/temp, water recovery/distribution, and atmosphere content.
- LEDS ~ red(630nm), green(530nm), blue(455nm), white(4100k), far-red(730nm) and infrared

## Importance
A supply run to the Internation Space Station can cost from $9000 - $180000 per pound, which is why pre-packed and freeze-dried food is the norm, however, they not only break down over time but cause vitamin deficiencies which could pose a problem for longer missions. 

Aerospace agriculture, or ag aviation is also important for farmers. The growth rate, or GDP, is 3.6%, and we are predicted to reach 9.7 billion people by 2050. This means that it's increasingly important for farmers to produce greater yields, and it is because of aviation that we can keep up with the growing population. This is done by using fungicides and pesticides which improve the production and yield of crops. This keeps plants safe from fungus and bug outbreaks in a matter of minutes!

Other Earth Applications~
- Purifying water
- Killing pathogens
- Improving Cancer Treatment effectivness
- Reduce waste
- Food security
- Mitigating pressure on the planet's ecosystem 
- Vertical Farming
- Urban food Procution

Fun Fact- Cotton seeds were sent to the International Space Station to study the effects of gravity on roots, which could create a cotton plant that absorbs water more efficiently. This could be life-changing to places with drought such as Texas and China where drought has affected cotton production.

## Growth Chambers
Growth Chambers, which are the base of farming within microgravity provide appropriate levels of light, air temperature, relative humidity, and carbon dioxide, all adjustable according to different species of plants. They also create a space where ventilation and irrigation systems are implanted and automatic with minimal action required from the space station on earth. 

Benefits:
- Replicate climates
- Year-round growth 
- Consistency in data
- Programmable conditions

## Automated irrigation system
Several systems are implanted to water plants in space, each having its purpose of determining plant hydration and health.

- Passive Orbital Nutrient Delivery System (PONDS): 
  - VEGGIE (Vegetable Production System) created PONDS, which works as a water nutrient delivery system. Their main component is the ceramic porous tubes, which do the transportation of nutrients and water to the roots, and do this while replacing the need for electricity or moving parts. The other components include the wicking material (which is hydrophilic, which increases capacity), reservoir (stores water and nutrient solution), and rooting module. (clay material that is where the plants are stored)
- Leaf Sensor
  - Hans Seelig and an employee of BioServe Space Technologies collaborated to research and create a sensor that could measure leaf thickness by electrical pulses. Their product came out as thin clips, which attached to the plant without damaging the plant. This sensor determines leaf turgidity (plant water levels and health) through a computer which allows users to analyze and evaluate if the plant needs better hydration.
- Passive Irrigation System
  - A system that uses no electricity, pumps, or moving parts, used in PONDS. This allows plants to be grown in space without soil, and instead porous ceramic tubes. 
- Hydroponic Method
  - The method of growing plants without soil, and through water-based solutions for nutrients. 
  - Advantages include: low system mass, natural aeration (air or gas circulation), simplicity, and automation potential. 
- APH25 facility
  - Experiments by the Advanced Plant Habitat (APH). Investigated growth patterns in microgravity conditions using an aeroponic system. 
- Plant Water Management (PWM) Technology
  - Uses capillary fluidics to become independent from gravity to manage water and deliver nutrients. They aim to overcome the struggles of inadequate aeration and oversaturation of the root zone. 
- Root Zone Moisture Sensors
  - Monitors moisture redistribution phenomena in microgravity, and is essential to managing plant growth with limited access to water.

## LED
To successfully grow on the International Space Station, there would need to be efficient light, however, because there would be a closed environment and no sunlight in space, LEDs are used to mimic sunlight. In fact, LEDs come with unique benefits due to their ability to be modified without causing harm. 

Let's break it down:
- Light Spectrum/Efficiency: LED lighting makes it possible to adjust to the right spectrum of light while reducing energy consumption and heat output, which increases plant growth and produces greater yields. 
- Red Light: Promotes stem and leaf growth, best efficiency when it comes to absorbing chlorophyll. They are also electrically efficient with red light emitting more photons/watt when compared to other LED lights. (600-700nm)
- Blue Light: Increases plant quality by promoting stomatal opening which helps develop healthy leaves and encouraging seedling growth. (450 - 490nm)
- Green Light: Enhances plant productivity by putting more focus on lower leaves that didn't receive as much blue/red light. (500-600nm)
- White Light: Used more for observing. Pictures can be taken and more easily analyzed for pests, diseases, nutrient deficiencies, etc.
- Safety: LED Luminaires are put on 48VDC, which is considered safe and initiates that if any circuits are damaged there will be no risk of electrocution. To add, there is no risk of breakage when in contact with water.
- Sustainability: LEDs make it possible to recycle water/nutrients and increase the overall efficiency of resources. For example, Vertical farming uses way less soil, therefore preventing issues in traditional farming such as erosion, degradation, or depletion.

## Fluid dynamics 
Computational fluid dynamics, or (CFD) describes how fluids (liquids and gases) behave in microgravity. This is used to predict the performance of multiple components in aircraft systems and is used heavily in space agriculture.

- Water Movement
  - Water is distributed in concentric circles around solution tubes due to capillary forces in microgravity, unlike in gravity where the solution would otherwise be pulled down due to gravity (-9.8). It's important to note that gravitation forces are greater than surface tension forces, meaning that water film is thin when surrounding particles. The opposite is true for microgravity, meaning pores can become trapped and create pockets that are oxygen deficient. 
  - Sensors to monitor this movement include pressure sensors, moisture sensor arrays, and oxygen sensors.
 
- Boundary layers
  - Undisturbed (or stagnant) layers of air surrounding plant organs. Major gases (carbon and water vapor) must be absorbed from bulk air to organs into these layers. 
  - At earths gravity ~ 1g, tehse layers are considered thin because of turbulent mixing (due to convective heat exchange), which allows for normal respiration and transpiration. 
  - Space gravity, however, has thicker boundary layers, making it harder to distribute/circulate gas.
  - Downfalls: Ex.  Reproductive failure in CHROMEX 4 spaceflight experiment
  - Advantages: Better seed development (if air distribution increases)

## Conclusion
Space agriculture has many uses/benefits to aerospace development and farming on Earth. The future of space agriculture can lead to unpredictable, and bright innovations especially now with multiple agricultural organizations working on the  International Space Station. This is and will be increasingly crucial to support life on Earth and future space explorations.
